        "description": "The superb Air 2S combines the best features of our two previous favorite DJI drones, the Mavic Air 2 and Mavic 2 Pro. You get the compact, folding design of the former, plus the 20MP 1-Inch sensor found in the latter. The combination is a brilliant one, making the Air 2S our top choice for hobbyists and also pros who need a small drone that they can take anywhere.",

        "description": "One of our few complaints about the DJI Mavic Mini was that it couldn't shoot 4K video – this excellent successor fixes that, while giving us a few extra treats in the process. The Mini 2 has the same ultra-compact design as before, making it the joint-smallest drone in DJI's line-up, but comes with a new controller that boosts it range (thanks to Ocusync 2.0 connectivity) and delivers a more polished flying experience.",

So should it be completely discounted? Not necessarily. Unlike the Air 2S, it offers variable aperture for changing your exposure mid-flight.

But despite the latter's inclusion of a 162mm telephoto lens, the Zoom still offers a unique 24-48mm optical zoom lens. If you're looking to capture close-up shots of subjects like people, while still maintaining the safe and legal distance of 50m, then it's still worth considering due to the quality of that optical zoom.",
